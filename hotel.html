    <h3>Paying Guests</h3>
    <p>
      Paying guest places are basically homes where you can stay by paying
      monthly rent.They give you a room, food, Wi-Fi, and other basic
      facilities, so it feels comfortable and convenient.It’s different from
      hotels because a PG feels more homely, and you meet other people living
      there too.It’s a good option if you want a safe, budget-friendly place to
      stay for a longer time
