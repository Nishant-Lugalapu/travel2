    <h1>Maharashtra</h1>
    <p>
      “Arrey, Maharashtra is like a full combo state, yaar. You get everything
      here – mega city vibe, ancient caves, beaches, forts, hill stations, crazy
      food, Bollywood feel, all in one place
    </p>

    <p>
      Mumbai alone is an experience – the rush at Marine Drive, night lights
      near the sea, cutting chai at the tapri, local trains, and that feeling
      that the whole country’s energy is packed into one city. You see the
      Gateway of India on one side, skyscrapers on the other, and you realise
      why people call it the ‘city of dreams’
