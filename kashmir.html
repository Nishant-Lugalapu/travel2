    <h1>Kashmir</h1>
    <p>
      “Bro, just go to Kashmir once. The place doesn’t even look real. You wake
      up, open the window, and there are mountains with snow on top, a cold
      breeze on your face, and everything feels super calm. Even just standing
      near Dal Lake and watching the shikaras move slowly is enough to clear
      your head.

      Gulmarg's your playground—gondola up to snowfields, ski if you're feeling
      it, or just roll around in powder like a kid. Pahalgam's rivers for
      rafting, pony rides through betaab valleys... it's adventure without the
      hassle, and the air? Clears your coding brain fog in one breath.
