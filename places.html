    <h1>Don't Miss these Places if you are here</h1>
    <h3>Beaches</h3>
    <p>
      Beaches are where the world slows down and life feels lighter.<br />The
      soft sand beneath your feet, the sound of waves meeting the shore,and the
      endless horizon create a peace you can’t find anywhere else.<br />Whether
      you seek adventure in the tides or calm in the sunsets,every beach offers
      a moment that stays with you.<br />It’s not just a destination—it’s a
      feeling, an escape,and an experience waiting for you to discover.

    <h3>Temples</h3>
    <p>
      They are filled with a quiet energy that makes you forget the noise of
      daily life.Whether you visit for prayer, blessings, or just a moment of
      silence,temples offer a space to reflect and feel renewed.Each temple has
      its own history, traditions, and beauty—from ancient carvings to the sound
      of ringing bells.A visit to a temple isn’t just a trip; it’s an experience
      that brings peace to the mind and warmth to the heart.
