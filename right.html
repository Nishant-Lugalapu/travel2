    <h1>Travelling</h1>
    <p>
      Travelling opens the door to exploring new cultures, experiencing diverse
      lifestyles, and discovering the beauty of the world. It allows people to
      step away from their daily routine and immerse themselves in unforgettable
      adventures. Whether it’s the calmness of a mountain valley, the excitement
      of a busy city, or the peace of a quiet beach, travelling creates memories
      that last forever. It also helps us learn new things, meet new people, and
      understand the world from different perspectives. Overall, travelling is
      not just about reaching a destination — it’s about the journey, the
      experiences, and the stories we gather along the way.
